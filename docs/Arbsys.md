title: The ArbSys Precompiled Contract
sidebar_label: ArbSys Precompiled Contract
---

ArbSys is a precompiled contract that exists in every Arbitrum Chain.
As its name would imply, ArbSys provides systems functionality useful to some Arbitrum contracts.
Any contract running on an Arbitrum Chain can call the chain's ArbSys.

ArbSys lives at address `0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000064` on every Arbitrum chain.
To call it, write something like this:

```sol
uint256 txCount = ArbSys(address(100)).getTransactionCount();
```

Here is the interface offered by ArbSys:

```sol
/**
* @title Precompiled contract that exists in every Arbitrum chain at address(100), 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000064. Exposes a variety of system-level functionality.

    * @return version number as int
     */

    /**

    /**

    * @return stotage value for the given account at the given index
    */
    function getStorageAt(address account, uint256 index) external view returns (uint256);
