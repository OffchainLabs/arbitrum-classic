Arbitrum is a suite of Ethereum scaling solutions that enables high-throughput, low cost smart contracts while remaining trustlessly secure. Arbitrum has three modes: AnyTrust Channels, AnyTrust Sidechains, and Arbitrum Rollup. The following documentation describes how to use Arbitrum Rollup, which is currently live on testnet and Mainnet. Whether you're a developer that just wants to start building or you're curious into digging deeper into the internals of Arbitrum and how it works, this site is the right place for you.

### How does Arbitrum work?

If you're looking to discover how Arbitrum works, the best place to begin is by the [Rollups basics](Rollup_basics.md) section, which gives a high level overview of Arbitrum's internals. From there, you can jump into more detailed explainers on various components of the system.

### How Can I Start Building?

If you want to get started using Arbitrum with no setup required, check out our [public testnets](Public_Chains.md).

You could use our [Tutorials](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum-tutorials) to get started with building on Arbitrum. This mono-repo includes various demos showing and explaining how to interact with Arbitrum â€” deploying and using contracts directly on L2, moving Ether and tokens between L1 and L2, and more.

We also show how you can use broadly supported Ethereum ecosystem tooling (Hardhat, Ethers-js, etc.) as well as our special Arbitrum SDK for convenience.
