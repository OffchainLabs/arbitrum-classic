- `newAdminFacet`: address of logic that owner of rollup calls

- `newUserFacet`: ddress of logic that user of rollup calls

### `setValidator(address[] _validator, bool[] _val)` (external)

Set the addresses of the validator whitelist

It is expected that both arrays are same length, and validator at
position i corresponds to the value at position i

Set base stake required for an assertion

- `newBaseStake`: maximum arbgas to be used per block

### `setStakeToken(address newStakeToken)` (external)
