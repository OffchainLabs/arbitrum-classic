IERC1363 Interface

Interface for a Payable Token contract as defined in
https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1363

### `transferAndCall(address recipient, uint256 amount) → bool` (external)

Transfer tokens from `msg.sender` to another address and then call `onTransferReceived` on receiver

- `recipient`: address The address which you want to transfer to

- `amount`: uint256 The amount of tokens to be transferred

**Returns**: true: unless throwing

### `transferAndCall(address recipient, uint256 amount, bytes data) → bool` (external)

Transfer tokens from `msg.sender` to another address and then call `onTransferReceived` on receiver

- `recipient`: address The address which you want to transfer to

- `amount`: uint256 The amount of tokens to be transferred

- `data`: bytes Additional data with no specified format, sent in call to `recipient`

**Returns**: true: unless throwing

### `transferFromAndCall(address sender, address recipient, uint256 amount) → bool` (external)

Transfer tokens from one address to another and then call `onTransferReceived` on receiver

- `sender`: address The address which you want to send tokens from

- `recipient`: address The address which you want to transfer to

- `amount`: uint256 The amount of tokens to be transferred

**Returns**: true: unless throwing

### `transferFromAndCall(address sender, address recipient, uint256 amount, bytes data) → bool` (external)

Transfer tokens from one address to another and then call `onTransferReceived` on receiver

- `sender`: address The address which you want to send tokens from

- `recipient`: address The address which you want to transfer to

- `amount`: uint256 The amount of tokens to be transferred

- `data`: bytes Additional data with no specified format, sent in call to `recipient`

**Returns**: true: unless throwing

### `approveAndCall(address spender, uint256 amount) → bool` (external)

Approve the passed address to spend the specified amount of tokens on behalf of msg.sender
and then call `onApprovalReceived` on spender.
Beware that changing an allowance with this method brings the risk that someone may use both the old
and the new allowance by unfortunate transaction ordering. One possible solution to mitigate this
race condition is to first reduce the spender's allowance to 0 and set the desired value afterwards:

- `spender`: address The address which will spend the funds

- `amount`: uint256 The amount of tokens to be spent
