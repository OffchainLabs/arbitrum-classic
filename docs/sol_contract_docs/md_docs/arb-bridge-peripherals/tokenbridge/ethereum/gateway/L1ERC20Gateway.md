Layer 1 Gateway contract for bridging standard ERC20s

This contract handles token deposits, holds the escrowed tokens on layer 1, and (ultimately) finalizes withdrawals.

Any ERC20 that requires non-standard functionality should use a separate gateway.
Messages to layer 2 use the inbox's createRetryableTicket method.
