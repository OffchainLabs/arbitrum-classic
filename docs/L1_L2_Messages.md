## Standard Arbitrum Transactions: Calls from clients

Standard, client-generated transaction calls on the Arbitrum chain are sent through the EthBridge using Inbox.sendL2Message:

```solidity
function sendL2Message(address chain, bytes calldata messageData) external;
```

Generally calls will come in batches from an aggregator as described in [Transaction Lifecycle](Tx_Lifecycle.md).

However, the Arbitrum protocol also offers ways of passing messages between the layer 1 and layer 2 chains.

The most common use-case for direct inter-chain communication is depositing and withdrawing assets; this, however, is only one specific application of generalized cross-chain contract calls that Arbitrum supports. This page covers the generalized protocol; for further explanation, see [Inside Arbitrum: Bridging](Inside_Arbitrum.md#bridging).

## Ethereum to Arbitrum: Retryable Tickets

#### Explanation

Arbitrum offers several ways for an Ethereum transaction to send a message to Arbitrum ([see "L2 Messages"](Data_Formats.md)); however, the generally recommended method to use for direct L1 to L2 communication is via retryable tickets.

The idea is the following: a layer 1 transaction is put in the Inbox with instructions to submit a transaction to L2 (including calldata, callvalue, and gas info) in such a way that if it doesn't execute successfully the first time, it gets put into an L2 "retry buffer." This means that for a period of time (likely on the scale of the chain's dispute window, so roughly one week), anybody can attempt to "redeem" the the L2 transaction ticket by re-executing it.

Note that the first execution of the L2 transaction happens automatically if any gas is provided, and in the happy / most-common case, it will simply succeed right then and there; thus, a user will typically have have to sign and publish a single transaction.

The rationale here is to account for cases like the following: say we want a transaction that lets a user deposit a token onto Arbitrum; this will entail escrowing some tokens in a contract on L1, and sending a message to mint the same amount of tokens on L2. Suppose that the L1 transaction succeeds but the L2 message reverts due to insufficient gas. In a naive implementation, this would be a serious problem â€” the user has simply transferred tokens a contract and received nothing on L2; those tokens are stuck in the contract indefinitely. With retryable tickets, however, the user (or anyone else) has a week to simply re-execute the L2 message with sufficient gas.

Additionally, the retryable ticket system safely accounts for cases where a user _overpays_ for the ArbGas required for the L2 transaction, and avoids any case in which a user would need to awkwardly pay for execution using gas in a contract address. If the user overpays ArbGas for the initial L2 execution, the excess Ether is refunded to the user at their specified address; if a user needs to re-execute the L2 transaction, they can execute it (and thus also fund it) from any EOA.

#### Retryable Tickets API

A convenience method for creating retryable tickets is exposed in `Inbox.createRetryableTicket`:

```sol
    /**
    @notice Put an message in the L2 inbox that can be re-executed for some fixed amount of time if it reverts
    * @dev all msg.value will deposited to callValueRefundAddress on L2
    * @param destAddr destination L2 contract address
    * @param l2CallValue call value for retryable L2 message
    * @param  maxSubmissionCost Max gas deducted from user's L2 balance to cover base submission fee
    * @param excessFeeRefundAddress maxGas x gasprice - execution cost gets credited here on L2 balance
    * @param callValueRefundAddress l2Callvalue gets credited here on L2 if retryable txn times out or gets cancelled
    * @param maxGas Max gas deducted from user's L2 balance to cover L2 execution
    * @param gasPriceBid price bid for L2 execution
    * @param data ABI encoded data of L2 message
    * @return unique id for retryable transaction (keccak256(requestID, uint(0) )
     */
    function createRetryableTicket(
        address destAddr,
        uint256 l2CallValue,
        uint256 maxSubmissionCost,
        address excessFeeRefundAddress,
        address callValueRefundAddress,
        uint256 maxGas,
        uint256 gasPriceBid,
        bytes calldata data
    ) external payable override returns (uint256)
```

See [EthErc20Bridge.depositToken](./sol_contract_docs/md_docs/arb-bridge-peripherals/tokenbridge/ethereum/EthERC20Bridge.md) for example usage.

Additionally, a precompiled `ArbRetryableTx` contract exists in every Arbitrum chain at address `0x000000000000000000000000000000000000006E`, which exposes methods relevant to retryable transactions:

## Arbitrum to Ethereum

### Explanation

L2 to L1 messages work similar to L1 to L2 messages, but in reverse: an L2 transaction is published with an L1 message as encoded data, to be executed later.

A key difference, however, is that in the L2 to L1 direction, a user must wait for the dispute period to pass between publishing their messages and actually executing it on L1; this is a direct consequence of the security model of Optimistic Rollups (see [finalty](Finality.md).) Additionally, unlike retyable tickets, outgoing messages have no upper bounded timeout; once the dispute window passes, they can be executed at any point. No rush.

### L2 to L1 Messages Lifecycle

The lifecycle of sending a message from layer 2 to layer 1 can be broken down into roughly 4 steps, only 2 which (at most!) require the end user to publish transactions.

**1. Publish L2 to L1 transaction (Arbitrum transaction)**

A client initiates the process by publishing a message on L2 via `ArbSys.sendTxToL1` (see [ArbSys](Arbsys.md), and see [ArbTokenBridge.withdraw](./sol_contract_docs/md_docs/arb-bridge-peripherals/tokenbridge/arbitrum/ArbTokenBridge.md) for example usage.

**2. Outbox entry gets created**

After the Arbitrum chain advances some set amount of time, ArbOS gathers all outgoing messages, Merklizes them, and publishes the root as an [OutboxEntry](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum/blob/master/packages/arb-bridge-eth/contracts/bridge/OutboxEntry.sol) in the chain's outbox. Note that this happens "automatically"; i.e., it requires no additional action from the user.

**3. Client gets Merkle proof of outgoing message**

After the Outbox entry is published on the L1 chain, the user (or anybody) can compute the Merkle proof of inclusion of their outgoing message. They do this by calling `NodeInterface.lookupMessageBatchProof`:

```sol

/** @title Interface for providing Outbox proof data
 *  @notice This contract doesn't exist on-chain. Instead it is a virtual interface accessible at 0x00000000000000000000000000000000000000C8
 * This is a cute trick to allow an Arbitrum node to provide data without us having to implement an additional RPC )
 */

interface NodeInterface {
    /**
    * @notice Returns the proof necessary to redeem a message
    * @param batchNum index of outbox entry (i.e., outgoing messages Merkle root) in array of outbox entries
    * @param index index of outgoing message in outbox entry
    * @return (
        * proof: Merkle proof of message inclusion in outbox entry
        * path: Index of message in outbox entry
        * l2Sender: sender if original message (i.e., caller of ArbSys.sendTxToL1)
        * l1Dest: destination address for L1 contract call
        * l2Block l2 block number at which sendTxToL1 call was made
        * l1Block l1 block number at which sendTxToL1 call was made
        * timestamp l2 Timestamp at which sendTxToL1 call was made
        * amouunt value in L1 message in wei
        * calldataForL1 abi-encoded L1 message data
        *
    */
    function lookupMessageBatchProof(uint256 batchNum, uint64 index)
        external
        view
        returns (
            bytes32[] memory proof,
            uint256 path,
            address l2Sender,
            address l1Dest,
            uint256 l2Block,
            uint256 l1Block,
            uint256 timestamp,
            uint256 amount,
            bytes memory calldataForL1
        );
}

```

**4. The user executes the L1 message (Ethereum Transaction)**

Anytime after the dispute window passes, any user can execute the L1 message by calling Outbox.executeTransaction; if it reverts, it can be re-executed any number of times and with no upper time-bound:

```sol
 /**
    * @notice Executes a messages in an Outbox entry. Reverts if dispute period hasn't expired and
    * @param outboxIndex Index of OutboxEntry in outboxes array
    * @param proof Merkle proof of message inclusion in outbox entry
    * @param index Index of message in outbox entry
    * @param l2Sender sender if original message (i.e., caller of ArbSys.sendTxToL1)
    * @param destAddr destination address for L1 contract call
    * @param l2Block l2 block number at which sendTxToL1 call was made
    * @param l1Block l1 block number at which sendTxToL1 call was made
    * @param l2Timestamp l2 Timestamp at which sendTxToL1 call was made
    * @param amount value in L1 message in wei
    * @param calldataForL1 abi-encoded L1 message data
     */
    function executeTransaction(
        uint256 outboxIndex,
        bytes32[] calldata proof,
        uint256 index,
        address l2Sender,
        address destAddr,
        uint256 l2Block,
        uint256 l1Block,
        uint256 l2Timestamp,
        uint256 amount,
        bytes calldata calldataForL1
    )
```

Note that convenience methods for the steps outlined here are provided in the [arb-ts](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum/tree/master/packages/arb-ts) client side library.
