## Standard Arbitrum Transactions: Calls from clients

Standard, client-generated transaction calls on the Arbitrum chain are sent through the EthBridge using Inbox.sendL2Message:

```solidity
function sendL2Message(address chain, bytes calldata messageData) external;
```

Generally calls will come in batches from an aggregator as described in [Transaction Lifecycle](Tx_Lifecycle.md).

However, the Arbitrum protocol also offers ways of passing messages between the layer 1 and layer 2 chains.

The most common use-case for direct inter-chain communication is depositing and withdrawing assets; this, however, is only one specific application of generalized cross-chain contract calls that Arbitrum supports. This page covers the generalized protocol; for further explanation, see [Inside Arbitrum: Bridging](Inside_Arbitrum.md#bridging).

## Ethereum to Arbitrum: Retryable Tickets

Retryable tickets are the Arbitrum protocol’s canonical method for passing generalized messages from Ethereum to Arbitrum. A retryable ticket is an L2 message encoded and delivered by L1; if gas is provided, it will be executed immediately. If no gas is provided or the execution reverts, it will be placed in the L2 retry buffer, where any user can re-execute for some fixed period (roughly one week).

### Motivation

Retryable tickets are designed to gracefully handle various potentially tricky aspects of cross-chain messaging:

- **Overpaying for L2 Gas:** An L1 contract has to supply gas for the L2 transaction’s execution; if the L1 side overpays, this begets the questions of what to do with this excess Ether.

- **L2 transaction reversion — breaking atomicity:** It is vital for many use-cases of L1 to L2 transactions that the state updates on both layers are atomic, i.e., if the L1 side succeeds, there is assurance that the L2 will eventually succeed as well. The canonical example here is a token deposit: on L1, tokens are escrowed in some contract, and a message is sent to L2 to mint some corresponding tokens. If the L1 side succeeds and the L2 reverts, the user has simply lost their tokens (i.e., donated them to the bridge contract).

- **L2 transaction reversion — handling L2 callvalue:** The L1 side must supply the Ether for the callvalue of the L2 transaction (by depositing it); if the L2 transaction reverts, this begets the questions of what to do with this in-limbo Ether.

Retryable tickets handle all these things (and handle them well!)

### Transaction Types / Terminology

| Txn Type           | Description                                                                                                                                           | Appearance                                                                                                                     | Tx ID                                                                  |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Retryable Ticket   | Quasi-transaction that sits in the retry buffer and has a lifetime over which it can be executed, i.e., “redeemed.”                                   | Emitted when message is included; will succeed if user supplies sufficient ETH to cover base-fee + callvalue, otherwise fails. | _keccak256(zeroPad(l2ChainId), zeroPad(bitFlipedinboxSequenceNumber))_ |
| Redemption Txn     | Transaction that results a retryable ticket being successfully redeemed; looks like a normal L2 transaction.                                          | Emitted after a retryable ticket is successfully redeemed, either user-initiated or via an auto-redeem.                        | _keccak256(zeroPad(retryable-ticket-id), 0)_                           |
| Auto-Redeem Record | Quasi-transaction ArbOS creates automatically which attempts to redeem a retryable ticket immediately when it is submitted using the ArbGas provided. | Attempted / emitted iff gas\*gas-price > 0. If it fails, retryable ticket stays in the retry buffer.                           | \_keccak256(zeroPad(retryable-ticket-id), 1)                           |

### Parameters:

There are a total of 10 parameters that the L1 must pass to the L2 when creating a retryable ticket.

5 of them have to do with allocating ETH/Gas:

**DepositValue:** Total ETH deposited from L1 to L2.
**CallValue:** Call-value for L2 transaction.
**GasPrice:** L2 Gas price bid for immediate L2 execution attempt (queryable via standard eth*gasPrice RPC)
**MaxGas:** Gas limit for immediate L2 execution attempt (can be estimated via \_NodeInterface.estimateRetryableTicket*)
**MaxSubmissionCost:** Amount of ETH allocated to pay for the base submission fee. The base submission fee is a parameter unique to retryable transactions; the user is charged the base submission fee to cover the storage costs of keeping their ticket’s calldata in the retry buffer. (current base submission fee is queryable via `ArbRetryableTx.getSubmissionPrice`)

Intuitively: if a user does not desire immediate redemption, they should provide a DepositValue of at least `CallValue + MaxSubmissionCost`. If they do desire immediate execution, they should provide a DepositValue of at least
`CallValue + MaxSubmissionCost + (GasPrice x MaxGas).`

### Other Parameters

**Destination Address:** Address from which transaction will be initiated on L2.
**Credit-Back Address:** Address to which all excess gas is credited on L2; i.e., excess ETH for base submission cost (`MaxSubmissionCost - ActualSubmissionCostPaid`) and excess ETH provided for L2 execution (` (GasPrice x MaxGas) - ActualETHSpentInExecution`).
**Beneficiary:** Address to which CallValue will be credited to on L2 if the retryable ticket times out or is cancelled. The Beneficiary is also the address with the right to cancel a Retryable Ticket (if the ticket hasn’t been redeemed yet).
`Calldata:` data encoding the L2 contract call.
`Calldata Size:` CallData size.

### Retryable Transaction Lifecycle:

When a retryable ticket is initiated from the L1, the following things take place:

- DepositValue is credited to the sender’s account on L2.
  - If DepositValue is less than MaxSubmissionCost + Callvalue, the Retryable Ticket fails.
- Submission fee is collected: submission fee is deducted from the sender’s L2 account; MaxSubmissionCost - submission fee is credited to Credit-Back Address.

- Callvalue is deducted from sender’s L2 account and a Retryable Ticket is successfully created.
  - If the sender has insufficient funds to cover the callvalue (even after the DepositValue has been credited), the Retryable Ticket fails.
- If MaxGas and MaxPrice are both > 0, an immediate redemption will be attempted:

- MaxGas x MaxPrice is credited to the Credit-Back Address.
- The retryable ticket is automatically executed —i.e., the transaction encoded in Calldata with Callvalue — with gas provided by the Credit-Back Address.
- If it succeeds, a successful Immediate-Redeem Txn is emitted along with a successful Redemption Transaction. Any excess gas remains in the Credit-Back Address.
- If it reverts, a failed Immediate-Redeem Txn is emitted, and the Retryable Ticket is placed in the retry-buffer.
  ...Otherwise, the Retryable Ticket goes straight into the retry buffer, and no Immediate-Redeem Txn is ever emitted.

Any user can redeem a Retryable Ticket in the retry buffer (before it expires) by calling ArbRetryableTicket.redeem(Redemption-TxID). The user provides gas the way they would a normal L2 transaction.

If the Retryable Ticket is cancelled or expires before it is redeemed, Callvalue is credited to Beneficiary.

### Depositing ETH via Retryables

Currently, the canonical method for depositing ETH into Arbitrum is via retryable tickets. A Retryable Ticket is created with 0 Callvalue, 0 MaxGas, 0 GasPrice, and empty Calldata. The DepositValue credited to the sender’s account in step 1 simply remains there.

The Retryable Ticket gets put in the retry buffer and can in theory be redeemed, but redeeming is a no-op.

Beyond the superfluous ticket creation, this is suboptimal in that the base submission fee is deducted from the amount deposited, so the user will see a (slight) discrepancy between the amount sent to be deposited and ultimate amount credited in their L2 address. A special message type Taylor-made for ETH deposits that handles them more cleanly will be exposed soon.

#### Retryable Tickets API

A convenience method for creating retryable tickets is exposed in `Inbox.createRetryableTicket`:

```sol
    /**
    @notice Put an message in the L2 inbox that can be re-executed for some fixed amount of time if it reverts
    * @dev all msg.value will deposited to callValueRefundAddress on L2
    * @param destAddr destination L2 contract address
    * @param l2CallValue call value for retryable L2 message
    * @param  maxSubmissionCost Max gas deducted from user's L2 balance to cover base submission fee
    * @param excessFeeRefundAddress maxGas x gasprice - execution cost gets credited here on L2 balance
    * @param callValueRefundAddress l2Callvalue gets credited here on L2 if retryable txn times out or gets cancelled
    * @param maxGas Max gas deducted from user's L2 balance to cover L2 execution
    * @param gasPriceBid price bid for L2 execution
    * @param data ABI encoded data of L2 message
    * @return unique id for retryable transaction (keccak256(requestID, uint(0) )
     */
    function createRetryableTicket(
        address destAddr,
        uint256 l2CallValue,
        uint256 maxSubmissionCost,
        address excessFeeRefundAddress,
        address callValueRefundAddress,
        uint256 maxGas,
        uint256 gasPriceBid,
        bytes calldata data
    ) external payable override returns (uint256)
```

Additionally, a precompiled `ArbRetryableTx` contract exists in every Arbitrum chain at address `0x000000000000000000000000000000000000006E`, which exposes methods relevant to retryable transactions:

```sol

    * @param txId unique identifier of retryabale message: keccak256(requestID, uint(0) )
    * @return New timeout of txId.
    */
    function keepalive(bytes32 txId) external payable returns(uint);

    event LifetimeExtended(bytes32 indexed txId, uint newTimeout);

    event Canceled(bytes32 indexed txId);
}


```

This ArbRetryableTx interface is instantiated and exposed `bridge` class of [arb-ts](https://arb-ts-docs.netlify.app/), i.e.,

```ts
myBridge.ArbRetryableTx.redeem('mytxid')
```

## Arbitrum to Ethereum

### Explanation

L2 to L1 messages work similar to L1 to L2 messages, but in reverse: an L2 transaction is published with an L1 message as encoded data, to be executed later.

A key difference, however, is that in the L2 to L1 direction, a user must wait for the dispute period to pass between publishing their messages and actually executing it on L1; this is a direct consequence of the security model of Optimistic Rollups (see [finalty](Finality.md).) Additionally, unlike retyable tickets, outgoing messages have no upper bounded timeout; once the dispute window passes, they can be executed at any point. No rush.

### L2 to L1 Messages Lifecycle

The lifecycle of sending a message from layer 2 to layer 1 can be broken down into roughly 4 steps, only 2 which (at most!) require the end user to publish transactions.

**1. Publish L2 to L1 transaction (Arbitrum transaction)**

A client initiates the process by publishing a message on L2 via `ArbSys.sendTxToL1`.

**2. Outbox entry gets created**

After the Arbitrum chain advances some set amount of time, ArbOS gathers all outgoing messages, Merklizes them, and publishes the root as an [OutboxEntry](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum/blob/master/packages/arb-bridge-eth/contracts/bridge/OutboxEntry.sol) in the chain's outbox. Note that this happens "automatically"; i.e., it requires no additional action from the user.

**3. Client gets Merkle proof of outgoing message**

After the Outbox entry is published on the L1 chain, the user (or anybody) can compute the Merkle proof of inclusion of their outgoing message. They do this by calling `NodeInterface.lookupMessageBatchProof`:

```sol

/** @title Interface for providing Outbox proof data
 *  @notice This contract doesn't exist on-chain. Instead it is a virtual interface accessible at 0x00000000000000000000000000000000000000C8
 * This is a cute trick to allow an Arbitrum node to provide data without us having to implement an additional RPC )
 */

interface NodeInterface {
    /**
    * @notice Returns the proof necessary to redeem a message
    * @param batchNum index of outbox entry (i.e., outgoing messages Merkle root) in array of outbox entries
    * @param index index of outgoing message in outbox entry
    * @return (
        * proof: Merkle proof of message inclusion in outbox entry
        * path: Index of message in outbox entry
        * l2Sender: sender if original message (i.e., caller of ArbSys.sendTxToL1)
        * l1Dest: destination address for L1 contract call
        * l2Block l2 block number at which sendTxToL1 call was made
        * l1Block l1 block number at which sendTxToL1 call was made
        * timestamp l2 Timestamp at which sendTxToL1 call was made
        * amouunt value in L1 message in wei
        * calldataForL1 abi-encoded L1 message data
        *
    */
    function lookupMessageBatchProof(uint256 batchNum, uint64 index)
        external
        view
        returns (
            bytes32[] memory proof,
            uint256 path,
            address l2Sender,
            address l1Dest,
            uint256 l2Block,
            uint256 l1Block,
            uint256 timestamp,
            uint256 amount,
            bytes memory calldataForL1
        );
}

```

**4. The user executes the L1 message (Ethereum Transaction)**

Anytime after the dispute window passes, any user can execute the L1 message by calling Outbox.executeTransaction; if it reverts, it can be re-executed any number of times and with no upper time-bound:

```sol
 /**
    * @notice Executes a messages in an Outbox entry. Reverts if dispute period hasn't expired and
    * @param outboxIndex Index of OutboxEntry in outboxes array
    * @param proof Merkle proof of message inclusion in outbox entry
    * @param index Index of message in outbox entry
    * @param l2Sender sender if original message (i.e., caller of ArbSys.sendTxToL1)
    * @param destAddr destination address for L1 contract call
    * @param l2Block l2 block number at which sendTxToL1 call was made
    * @param l1Block l1 block number at which sendTxToL1 call was made
    * @param l2Timestamp l2 Timestamp at which sendTxToL1 call was made
    * @param amount value in L1 message in wei
    * @param calldataForL1 abi-encoded L1 message data
     */
    function executeTransaction(
        uint256 outboxIndex,
        bytes32[] calldata proof,
        uint256 index,
        address l2Sender,
        address destAddr,
        uint256 l2Block,
        uint256 l1Block,
        uint256 l2Timestamp,
        uint256 amount,
        bytes calldata calldataForL1
    )
```
