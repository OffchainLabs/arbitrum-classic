Arbitrum is a suite of Ethereum scaling solutions that enables high-throughput, low cost smart contracts while remaining trustlessly secure. Arbitrum has three modes: AnyTrust Channels, AnyTrust Sidechains, and Arbitrum Rollup. The following documentation describes how to use Arbitrum Rollup, which is currently live on testnet.

If you're an user looking forward to using Arbitrum, this is the perfect place for you to get started.

## Steps to get started

### Where to start

For starters you should get your favourite wallet set up and connected to Arbitrum's latest testnet. How about open up Metamask and add Arbitrum as a network? You can find the needed information [here](Public_Testnet.md#Connection-Information).

Once that is out of the way you should header over to our [Token Faucet](https://faucet.arbitrum.io/) to grab some tokens. In this dApp you are able to claim some ERC20 tokens and ether to start interacting with the testnet.

### What to do

There is a list of deployed dApps over at the [Arbitrum Portal](https://portal.arbitrum.io/). You can head over and click on the different links to play around.

### But what is gonig on

Head over to the [Arbitrum Explorer](https://explorer.arbitrum.io/) to view transactions going through the Arbitrum Rollup chain.
